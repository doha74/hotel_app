# Hotel Booking - Intermediate Evaluation
I am coding the Hotel Booking system by working with Kotlin and XML. The following features are expected until the final delivery:
-	User authentication / registration
-	Filter available hotels in a region between user defined dates
-	See the hotels rating and comments
-	See available rooms and prices
-	Booking a room
-	Cancelling a book
-	Rate and comment the room if stayed

User authentication / registration from the above features are now available. Most of the UI is available. New pages and features not added above will be added until the final report. The pages currently available are as follows:
-	Splash Screen
-	Login Page
-	Register Page
-	Home Page
-	Profile Page
-	Search Results Page
-	Payment Page
-	My Trips Page
-	Hotel Page
In addition to these pages, a comment and rating page, forgot password page and a profile customisation screen will be added.

 Note: Most screenshots feature ScrollView. Some invisible parts in the screenshots are not caused by any error.
